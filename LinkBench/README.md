Interlinking / Data Integration Benchmark
=========================================

Interlinking is the process connecting two different data sources. Within GeoKnow, the primary interlinking tool is LIMES. This benchmark consists of a set of LIMES link specifications. Throughout the GeoKnow project, the execution time of executing those link specifications will be measured to track the effect of performance improvements..
